## Specs / Tests

| Test | Input | Output |
|:---------------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------|

| Name and Phone inputs should log| Parker Benoit, 206 123 4567 | Parker Benoit 206 123 4567 |

//| Select pizza size | pizza size | returns size user chose from checkbox|//

//| Pick pizza toppings | toppings | returns toppings user chose from checkboxes |//

| Return overall price of order | complete results from our html form with inputs from the checklist | a total price added together in regards to size and toppings chosen by user |

My tests have all worked at seperate times, but now that I figured out how to get my order price to print, my toppings and size won't...

## Known Bugs

Currently don't have some user input displayed on page after clicking submit. Error message on line 68 of js file
